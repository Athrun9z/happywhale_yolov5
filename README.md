# happywhale_yolov5

This repository is about a competition on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin?rvi=1
I'm trying to reproduce Awsaf's code for yolov5, but I'm running into some problems that are causing my model to not work as well as Awsaf's,
and I've been puzzling over it for a long time, so I've decided to ask about it on github.

here is the structure about this repostory:
